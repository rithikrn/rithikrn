Hey there, I'm Rithik R. Nambiar! 🚀

I'm a fresh face on GitHub, blending my aerospace journey with the adventures of coding. Here's a snapshot of my universe:

- **Reluctant Coder Turned GitHub Explorer:**  
  I used to dodge coding like turbulence on a clear flight 😅—now I'm diving into the code cosmos with a hearty mix of humor, curiosity, and just a pinch of delightful confusion.

- **Aerospace Adventurer:**  
  With a B.Tech from MIT Manipal 🎓 and currently soaring through my MS in Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University, I'm on a mission to navigate the skies, ride offshore waves, and decode the mysteries behind real and computational simulations.

- **Engineering Enthusiast:**  
  Whether it’s computational fluid dynamics, aeroacoustics, or wave energy, every challenge is a welcome opportunity to learn and innovate. 🛠️

- **Creative Code Connoisseur:**  
 Though I'm still a GitHub newbie, I'm excited to mix creativity, science, and a pinch of humor into my projects 🌟.

> *"A smooth flight never made a skilled pilot—and a bug-free code never made a legendary coder."* 🎉💫
